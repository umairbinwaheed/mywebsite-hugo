abstract: We compare the three main types of high-order one-step initial value solvers - extrapolation, spectral deferred correction, and embedded Runge窶適utta pairs. We consider orders four through twelve, including both serial and parallel implementations. We cast extrapolation and deferred correction methods as fixed-order Runge窶適utta methods, providing a natural framework for the comparison. The stability and accuracy properties of the methods are analyzed by theoretical measures, and these are compared with the results of numerical tests. In serial, the eighth-order pair of Prince and Dormand (DOP8) is most efficient. But other high-order methods can be more efficient than DOP8 when implemented in parallel. This is demonstrated by comparing a parallelized version of the well-known ODEX code with the (serial) DOP853 code. For an $N$-body problem with $N=400$, the experimental extrapolation code is as fast as the tuned Runge窶適utta pair at loose tolerances, and is up to two times as fast at tight tolerances.
